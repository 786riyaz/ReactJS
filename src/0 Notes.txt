The Context API in React is used for managing and sharing state globally across a component tree without having to pass props manually at every level (known as prop drilling).

ðŸ”‘ Key Uses of Context API:

Avoids Prop Drilling
Instead of passing data through multiple levels of components as props, Context provides a way to supply data directly to deeply nested components.

Global State Management (Lightweight)
Useful for smaller applications or specific use cases where you donâ€™t want to install a heavy state management library like Redux or Zustand.

Share Common Data
Perfect for data that many components need, such as:

Theme (dark/light mode)

User authentication details

Current language (i18n)

Shopping cart state

App-wide settings
